Context: Bacteria can be grown in the laboratory on nutrient culture media, but viruses need living cells in which to replicate. Many vaccines to infectious diseases can be grown in fertilised chicken eggs. Millions of eggs are used each year to generate the annual flu vaccine requirements, a complex process that takes about six months after the decision is made as to what strains of virus to include in the new vaccine. A problem with using eggs for this purpose is that people with egg allergies are unable to be immunised, but this disadvantage may be overcome as new techniques for cell-based rather than egg-based culture become available. Cell-based culture will also be useful in a pandemic when it may be difficult to acquire a sufficiently large quantity of suitable sterile, fertile eggs.
Question: What new technology is being used in teh vaccine making process that will make vaccines safer and eaier for most consumers? A: mRNA technology B: Cell-based culture C: fertilized chicken eggs D: Nanoparticles
Answer: mRNA technology is the new technology being used in the vaccine-making process that will make vaccines safer and easier for most consumers. This innovative approach allows for a faster development of vaccines and has shown promising results in providing immunity against various diseases. Therefore, the answer is A: mRNA technology.
